# Load Testing the Link Sharing Service

## Background

The scripts in this directory are trial attempts to load test the Link Sharing Service.  We've 
seen slow down of the entire network stack in certain environments.  There is growing evidence 
that this issue may be related to congestion control or network stack misconfiguration.

These tests are not designed to be run as part of a regular regression test, they are for 
troubleshooting only.
